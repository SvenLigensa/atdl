# Understanding Grounding DINO

- `Preprocess_Data.ipynb` loads the raw aerial imagery (TIFF files) and stores the RGB channels in PNG format. Then, interesting crops of these images were identified.
- `Aerial_Imagery.ipynb` applies Grounding DINO (https://github.com/IDEA-Research/GroundingDINO) to aerial imagery.
- `results/` stores the results of applying Grounding DINO, listed in the order, as they were generated by `Aerial_Imagery.ipynb`.
